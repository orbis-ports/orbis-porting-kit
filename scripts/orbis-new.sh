# only with orbis-compat which seems to be a set of modifications for openorbis but its unclear how
# to set it up". Every word of that is accurate. The pieces are all documented and none of the
# documentation is where a person looks first, so this script is the documentation that runs.
#
# ⚠ AND THE CHECK HALF IS THE IMPORTANT HALF. Every dependency below has cost this project a
# session at some point, and most of them fail in a way that names something else: no ld.lld looks
# like a broken linker script, no Rosetta looks like a missing packaging tool, a -D that did not
# survive try_compile looks like a toolchain file demanding the flag you just gave it. What is
# missing is printed with what it is, where to get it, and where to put it.

# $NAME

A PlayStation 4 program, built with the OpenOrbis SDK, [orbis-porting-kit]($KIT) and the
[orbis-compat]($COMPAT) overlay.

\`\`\`sh
./build.sh                            # build and package
./build.sh --deploy 192.168.1.50      # and put it on the console
\`\`\`

Then install it from the console's package menu. \`$KIT/scripts/ps4/logs.sh\` catches the output.

Title id is \`$TITLEID\`, generated at random. ⚠ **Change it if you publish anything**: two packages
sharing a title id overwrite each other on the console.

Three things about this platform that are not obvious, all of them in the generated sources:

* **Do not return from \`main()\`.** It is reported as \`CE-34878-0\` and looks like a crash.
* **Pass the toolchain paths in the environment, not with \`-D\`.** CMake drops \`-D\` entries inside
  \`try_compile\`, which is where the toolchain file is read a second time.
* **Do not link \`orbis::compat\` yourself.** The toolchain file already force-loads it.

\`$KIT/README.md\` is the kit; \`$COMPAT/README.md\` section 2 is what the overlay corrects and why.
