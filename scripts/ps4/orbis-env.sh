# It resolves and VERIFIES the two paths every project in this organisation needs, and exports
# them so anything further down - cmake, meson, a toolchain file - sees the same values:
#
#   ORBIS_COMPAT_DIR   this overlay: the toolchain file, the libc and pthread shims, the Vulkan
#                      loader shim, packaging and console logging
#   OO_PS4_TOOLCHAIN   the OpenOrbis SDK
#
# ⚠ FINDING THIS FILE CANNOT ITSELF BE SHARED, which is why each entry point carries six lines of
# path search before it can source this one. That is the chicken-and-egg of a shared prologue and
# there is no way around it; what CAN be shared is everything after, which is why the verification,
# the error messages and the helpers live here rather than being copied five times and drifting.
# Copy the search block verbatim from ps4/build.sh in any repository of the org.

# packaged the previous day's work with nothing anywhere announcing it.
