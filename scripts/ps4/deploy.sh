# and text files are compared byte for byte.
#
# ⚠ SIZE DOES NOT PROVE FRESHNESS. Three different CTS packages built on three different days were
# all exactly 109117440 bytes. This checks that what ARRIVED matches what was SENT; whether what was
# sent is what you meant is a different question, and the build script that made it is where that
# gets answered.

# between two lines with no message at all - the upload looked half-done and said nothing about why.
# That is the shape this whole project spends its time hunting, built by hand into the tool meant to
# report it. Every lftp call now goes through one function that checks the status and prints what
# lftp said.
# ⚠ AND IT MAY NOT HANG EITHER. lftp retries a refused connection FOREVER by default, so a console
# that is off - or wedged, which this one does - turned the script into a process that printed the
# filename and then sat there. Measured: ninety seconds against an unroutable address with no output
# and no exit. Three settings bound it; a tool that hangs reports as little as one that lies.
