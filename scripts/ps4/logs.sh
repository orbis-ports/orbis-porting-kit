# Capture log output from the console into a timestamped file.
#
#   scripts/ps4/logs.sh              # primary:  app-level UDP netlog (port 18194)
#   scripts/ps4/logs.sh klog         # fallback: GoldHEN klog server over TCP 3232
#
# Start this BEFORE launching the title, then leave it running for the session.
# Output goes to build-ps4-logs/ps4-<mode>-<timestamp>.log (gitignored via the
# repo's `*build-*/` rule) and to the terminal.
#
# Why UDP is primary: the console's stdout write blocks the calling thread when
# nothing is draining GoldHEN's klog socket, which stalls a render loop for
# seconds per line. sceNetSendto is fire-and-forget and cannot stall the title.
# klog stays as the fallback because it is the only channel that shows output
# from before our code runs, and from panics we never get to log ourselves.
#
# Environment:
#   PS4_IP        console address, klog mode only  (default 192.168.100.2)
#   PS4_LOG_PORT  udp bind port                    (default 18194)
#   PS4_KLOG_PORT GoldHEN klog port                (default 3232)
#   PS4_LOG_DIR   capture directory                (default <repo>/build-ps4-logs)
#   PS4_LOG_ALLOW udp source-address filter        (default any)
#                   any        accept every source, and say so on the first line
#                   console    accept only $PS4_IP
#                   <addr>,…   accept only these addresses
#
# Why the filter is OFF by default here and was ALWAYS ON in the automated harness:
# that harness read what arrived on this port as evidence — a stray line
# from an emulator run in another session matched a FORBIDDEN rule once and failed a
# green console run — so there it must be impossible for a second sender to be heard.
# This script decides nothing. Its output is read by a human who is usually mid
# bring-up, and the console's address is exactly the thing that is unknown then: it
# comes from DHCP (link.sh hands out .50-.150), so a filter defaulted to $PS4_IP would
# answer "console says nothing" to a console that was talking. Instead the receiver
# names every foreign source the moment it appears, which is the diagnosis rather than
# the silence — and `PS4_LOG_ALLOW=console` is one word away once the address is known.
#
# UNTESTED against hardware from the session that wrote it; the transports and
# ports mirror ps4doom's field-proven `make netlog` / `make klog` rules.
