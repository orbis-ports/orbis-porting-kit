# THE SUITE IS ITSELF UNDER TEST. This script puts each of the 2026-09-17 defects back into the
# release scripts, one at a time, runs the case that is supposed to catch it, and requires that
# case to go RED. Then it puts the file back.
#
#   scripts/release/test/mutations.sh [<mutation-name-substring>]
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. run.sh going green proves that twenty-seven assertions held. It does NOT prove
# that any of them could have failed - and "a check that cannot fail" is precisely the shape of
# five of the six defects this whole exercise is about: `grep -q` under pipefail always said
# ABSENT, the truncating sed always said MISSING, the guard above project() always fired. A
# suite that inherited that shape would report green and stop anyone looking. build.sh already
# holds test/crt_abi.sh to this standard by running it against a decoy object and requiring a
# non-zero exit; this is the same idea applied to a suite instead of to one comparison.
#
# ⚠ IT EDITS THE WORKING TREE AND PUTS IT BACK. Every file it touches is copied first and
# restored after each mutation, including on failure, and the last thing it does is compare
# every file against its copy byte for byte and refuse to exit 0 if any differ. Run it on a
# tree you have committed or stashed if that still makes you nervous; it is not run by run.sh
# for exactly that reason.
#
# ⚠ A MUTATION THAT NO LONGER APPLIES IS A FAILURE, NOT A SKIP. If the string it patches has
# moved, the patch is a no-op, the suite stays green for the honest reason, and this script
# would read that as "the defect was caught". It is not. Each mutation asserts it matched
# exactly once.
#
# Exit codes: 0 every defect was caught and every file restored · 1 otherwise · 2 usage.
