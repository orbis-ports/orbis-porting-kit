# The test suite for scripts/release/. Run it with no arguments; it needs no network, no SDK,
# no Mesa bundle and no console, and it finishes in seconds.
#
#   scripts/release/test/run.sh [--keep] [--list] [--no-skips] [<case-id> ...]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT IS AIMED AT. bundle-gate.sh's first full run on 2026-09-17 took
# ten attempts and SIX of the failures were in the checking machinery rather than in any bundle
# it judged (the list is in that script's header and in scripts/release/README.md). ~1800 lines
# of release scripts had, until this file, exactly one way of being exercised: push, wait for
# CI, read a log. Three of eight CI failures in the last release round were again in this
# machinery. Every case below is either a regression test for one of those six defects or a row
# of the pairing matrix they live in.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ the rule this suite follows
#
# ⚠ A TEST THAT CANNOT FAIL IS NOT A TEST. test/crt_abi.sh states the principle for this
# repository and build.sh enforces it by running that script against a decoy object and
# REQUIRING a non-zero exit. The same discipline here, in three forms:
#
#   * every "must refuse" case is paired with a "must accept" case over inputs that differ in
#     exactly the one field under test, so a check that refuses everything shows up as a failure
#     rather than as a green run;
#   * every static check (the ones that read a script's text because the behaviour needs a
#     three-hour Mesa build to reach) is run twice - once over the real file, once over a
#     deliberately broken copy - and the case fails unless the decoy is caught;
#   * the three verdicts the scripts use are asserted EXACTLY. OK is exit 0, INCOMPLETE is
#     exit 4, FAILED is exit 1, and "non-zero" is never accepted as a result. Conflating
#     INCOMPLETE with FAILED is defect 2 - it made bundle-gate.sh refuse every bundle it exists
#     to fix - and a suite that accepted "it errored" would have shipped it too.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ what it cannot reach
#
# Stated here rather than faked. bundle-gate.sh stages 3-6 need a cross toolchain, a real SDK
# and a real port; stage 5 alone is a three-hour OpenGothic build. What this suite runs of that
# script is stage 0 (host tools), stage 1 (unpack) and stage 1b (the offline verify and its
# INCOMPLETE tolerance, which IS defect 2's other half); the two defects that live past that
# point - the SIGPIPE count in stage 4 and the build-directory isolation in stage 5 - are
# covered by evaluating the real source line (F1) and by a decoy-checked read of the real
# invocation (F2). Each case says so in its own "why" line.
#
# Exit codes: 0 every case passed · 1 at least one case FAILED · 2 usage.
