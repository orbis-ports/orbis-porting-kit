# Fixtures for scripts/release/test/run.sh. Sourced, never executed on its own.
#
# WHY SYNTHETIC INPUTS AT ALL. The three scripts under test are gated by a Mesa bundle
# (three hours to build, ~90 MB unpacked) and an OpenOrbis SDK (289 MB unpacked on this
# machine, measured 2026-09-18). Neither is needed to exercise the LOGIC: make-sdk-bundle.sh
# reads `manifest.txt` with `sed -n 's/^k=//p'` and copies directories, and
# verify-sdk-bundle.sh reads BUNDLE.txt, mesa/manifest.txt, SHA256SUMS and ONE archive. So the
# fixtures give those scripts the real SHAPE - a manifest with the real field names in the real
# order, a bundle layout with every path check 6 reaches for - and stub bytes everywhere the
# content is not read. scripts/release/README.md already recorded this technique working
# ("a complete 145-file bundle was staged, hashed, manifested and tarred (375 KB) from a
# SYNTHETIC SDK and a SYNTHETIC Mesa bundle"); this file is that stand-in written down instead
# of retyped per session.
#
# ⚠ WHAT IS NOT SYNTHETIC, AND MUST NOT BECOME SO:
#
#   build/liborbis-compat.a   the REAL archive from this checkout. verify check 5 reads it with
#                             nm and compares against the import list. Defect 1 (the
#                             `sed 's/^_//'` that truncated `_Znwm`) is only reproducible
#                             against real Itanium-ABI C++ symbols; a stub archive would make
#                             that regression test assert nothing. Measured 2026-09-18: the
#                             archive defines 85 names, 3 of them `_Z...`, and all 12 names in
#                             orbis-mesa-a4fa6b57f8bd's real import list.
#   include/                  the REAL 27-file header tree, because the include/ fingerprint is
#                             the thing under test in half these cases and a two-file stand-in
#                             would hash just as happily while proving less about ordering.
#   licenses/ NOTICE.md       come from the real checkout: make-sdk-bundle.sh takes them from
#   LICENSING.md              $REPO (itself), not from --compat, and the licence gate is a real
#                             gate that a broken ledger must still fail.

#
# ⚠ THE TWO CONTENT PROBES ARE REAL PROBES. make-sdk-bundle.sh refuses an SDK that lacks

# cannot serve: it is dirty right now, its history is fixed, and a test that had to commit to
# it would be a test nobody dares run.
#
# Three commits, and each one exists to make one row of the matrix reachable:
#   A  the base.
#   B  README.md only - `git diff A B -- include/` is EMPTY. This is the shape that cost a

#      to accept.
