# Cut ONE versioned, licence-complete PS4 SDK bundle: everything a stranger needs to port
# their own software, in one tarball, pointed at by one CMake toolchain file.
#
# WHAT A CONSUMER HAS TO DO TODAY, AND WHY THIS EXISTS. Fetch the OpenOrbis SDK by release
# tag; clone orbis-compat at a commit sha; build it; fetch a Mesa bundle by tag; export four
# environment variables; and copy a ~330-line GitHub composite action. That action has been
# copy-pasted into three repositories and they have drifted - measured 2026-09-17:
#
#   OpenGothic/.github/workflows/ps4.yml:52     ORBIS_COMPAT_REF 44934e4  (= HEAD)
#   RetroArch/.github/workflows/cores.yml:117   ORBIS_COMPAT_REF ab4c066  (= HEAD~1)
#   mesa-ps4/.github/workflows/release.yml:49   ORBIS_COMPAT_REF 2460acb  <- Mesa was BUILT here
#
# Between 2460acb and HEAD there are 14 commits and 362 changed lines under include/ -
# signal.h +135, sys/umtx.h +48, orbis_thread.h +56. Mesa compiled against the old headers
# and links against the new archive. After this script, a bundle is a single pinned thing and
# that class of drift cannot be expressed.
#
# =========================================================================================
# ⚠ MESA AND ORBIS-COMPAT ARE FROZEN TOGETHER IN HERE, AND mesa-ps4 DELIBERATELY DOES THE
#   OPPOSITE. Read its release.yml header first; it is not wrong, it is answering a
#   different question.
#
#   Its words: "orbis-compat IS NOT IN THE TARBALL, and that is the point of the manifest.
#   Mesa's archives carry undefined references only orbis-compat satisfies, but they are
#   resolved at the FINAL link, where -lorbis-compat is already on the line. Bundling a copy
#   would freeze the layer that changes most often inside an artifact meant to change least.
#   What ships instead is the list of names Mesa imports from it, so a consumer can assert
#   the interface without pinning the commit."
#
#   That is correct FOR MESA'S OWN ARTIFACT. mesa-ps4 publishes a component to be consumed by
#   a build that also has its own orbis-compat, and freezing one inside the other would make
#   every overlay fix require a three-hour Mesa rebuild. The looseness is the feature.
#
#   It is wrong FOR A REDISTRIBUTABLE SDK, for one reason the import list cannot reach. That
#   assertion checks that every name Mesa imports is STILL DEFINED - its own comment says so:
#   "presence, not meaning. Constants inlined at Mesa's compile time leave no symbol to check
#   at all." Between 2460acb and HEAD, `include/signal.h` grew 135 lines and `sys/umtx.h` 48.
#   A struct that changed size, a macro that changed value, a `sigevent` whose fields moved -
#   none of those move a symbol NAME, so none of them fail that gate, and all of them are
#   silent ABI breaks in a driver that compiled cleanly. mesa-ps4 can accept that risk
#   because its consumer is a build it controls. A stranger downloading one tarball cannot
#   accept it, cannot detect it, and would have no idea which half to suspect.
#
#   So: this bundle refuses to be cut unless the Mesa bundle's own manifest says it was built
#   against the SAME HEADERS as the orbis-compat going in beside it - the same include/ bytes,
#   not the same commit id (that rule cost a rebuild per README typo; see the gate below).
#   Since 2026-09-18 the manifest records orbis-compat-include-sha256, so the comparison is
#   between two numbers measured on two machines rather than a diff this script does alone,
#   and verify-sdk-bundle.sh redoes it offline from the tarball. --allow-pair-mismatch exists
#   for a maintainer who knows better on a given day; it stamps BUNDLE.txt so loudly that
#   verify-sdk-bundle.sh fails on it afterwards.

#
#   scripts/release/verify-sdk-bundle.sh            (recomputes it from the unpacked bundle)
#   mesa-ps4 .github/workflows/release.yml, step "Manifest"
#                                                   (records what MESA ACTUALLY COMPILED)
#
# They cannot share a file: Mesa is built on a runner, the bundle is cut on another machine,
# and a stranger verifies holding nothing but the tarball. The three numbers are compared for
# EQUALITY, so any drift between the copies reads as a mismatched pair and refuses a bundle
# that is perfectly fine. Change all three in one commit or not at all.
#
# The algorithm, stated once:
#
#   sha256 over the concatenation of "<sha256 of file>  <path>\n" for every REGULAR FILE under
#   include/, the paths relative to the directory handed in, ordered by LC_ALL=C sort.
#
# Paths are inside the hash, so a header that only MOVED still changes it - which matters
# because Mesa's -isystem search order is what turns a move into a different compile.
#
# ⚠ NUL-DELIMITED AND LOOPED RATHER THAN `xargs`, the same reasoning SHA256SUMS gives further
# down: xargs splits on whitespace and re-quotes, so one header under a directory with a space
# in its name would silently hash two names that do not exist. include/ has 27 files and none
# of them needs that today; the point is that it keeps being right when it does not.
#
# ⚠ sha256sum AND shasum -a 256 PRINT THE SAME BYTES - "<64 hex><space><space><name>\n",
# checked against each other 2026-09-18 - which is the only reason a bundle cut on macOS and a
# Mesa built on ubuntu-latest can be compared at all. _sha256 picks whichever exists; do not

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAIR=ok
# ⚠ WHAT MESA COMPILES AGAINST IS include/, AND THIS USED TO COMPARE COMMIT IDS. Any commit to
# this repository invalidated the pair - a typo fixed in a README, a comment rewritten, a change
# to THIS SCRIPT - because the test was sha equality rather than anything Mesa can observe.
#
# Measured 2026-09-17: a bundle was refused over cc75949..4f61d6f, three commits touching
# LICENSING.md, build.sh, crt/orbis_crt1.c and make-sdk-bundle.sh. `git diff -- include/` across
# that range is EMPTY. Under the old rule a release meant freezing this repository, rebuilding
# Mesa, and cutting the bundle with not one commit in between - which is not a process anybody
# would follow twice.
#
# So: the shas are still recorded, and they are still what BUNDLE.txt reports, because provenance
# is worth having. What REFUSES is a difference in include/.
#
# ⚠ AND SINCE 2026-09-18 THERE IS A BETTER TEST THAN ANY DIFF: mesa-ps4's manifest records
# orbis-compat-include-sha256, the fingerprint of the include/ tree Mesa ACTUALLY COMPILED,
# measured on the runner by the same _include_sha256 defined at the top of this file. Comparing
# that against the tree going into the tarball needs no history, no reachable commit and no trust
# in either repository's idea of which commit was checked out - and it is the same number
# verify-sdk-bundle.sh recomputes from an unpacked bundle, so the verdict stops being something
# this script asserts and becomes something a stranger can re-derive. The git diff stays as the
# fallback for Mesa bundles cut before that field existed.
#
# ⚠ AND WHEN THE COMPARISON CANNOT BE MADE, THE OLD RULE STILL APPLIES. A shallow clone resolves
# the old commit object without its tree, so there is nothing to diff; refusing on the sha is then
# the honest answer, and the message says which case it is. The workflow fetches full history so
# that this is the rare path rather than the normal one.
