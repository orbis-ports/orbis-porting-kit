#
# ⚠ RUN IN FULL ON 2026-09-17, AND THE WARNING THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS EARNED. It said this
# script had never executed, that everything in it was reasoned from the build files it drives
# rather than observed, and to expect the first real run to find something. It found six, and all
# six were in this file and its neighbours rather than in any bundle:
#
#   verify-sdk-bundle.sh  sed 's/^_//' truncated every Itanium-ABI C++ name - _Znwm could not match
#   verify-sdk-bundle.sh  a dirty tree was FAILED, not INCOMPLETE, so this gate refused every
#                         bundle it exists to fix. A deadlock against itself
#   hello/CMakeLists.txt  the guard sat above project(), where nothing the toolchain file sets
#                         exists yet, so it refused every correct invocation
#   hello/CMakeLists.txt  the overlay archive was force-loaded twice and every symbol duplicated
#   bundle-gate.sh        grep -q under set -o pipefail: SIGPIPE killed llvm-nm, pipefail took its
#                         141, and a matching grep reported the overlay ABSENT from an image with
#                         16 of its symbols in it
#   bundle-gate.sh        stage 5 let the port choose its own build directory, so run N compiled
#                         against run N-1's deleted sysroot. README section 9 trap 7, inside the
#                         script whose header quotes that trap as its reason to exist
#
# Each fix carries the measurement that produced it. The run ended GATE PASSED against SDK v0.5.4,
# orbis-mesa-a4fa6b57f8bd and OpenGothic; both eboots carry the Orbis SELF magic 4f15 3d1d.
#
# ⚠ WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT DO IS RUN ANYTHING. A cross-linked PS4 image does not execute on a build
# machine. hello and triangle were both run on a console by hand the same day - see orbis-compat's
# README section 0 - and that is a fact about those two runs, not something gate=pass asserts.
#
# =========================================================================================
# WHY "FROM THE UNPACKED BUNDLE" IS THE WHOLE POINT.
#
# README §9 trap 7: "A stale build directory answers questions about a build that no longer
# exists. ~/.cache/tempest-og/build-ps4 still compiles og_ps4_mmap.cpp and links no overlay at
# all; the title's real build directory is ~/.cache/opengothic-ps4/build. Read link.txt before
# concluding anything from a build tree."
#
# That trap cost a day, and a release script reproduces it perfectly if it is careless. The
# machine that cuts a bundle has: an SDK at ~/.local/opt/openorbis, an orbis-compat checkout
# with build/liborbis-compat.a already in it, a Mesa build tree, four environment variables
# pointing at all of them, and very likely a cache directory holding a build configured
# against those paths months ago. A build run there succeeds by finding the ORIGINALS. It
# proves the machine works. It proves nothing about the tarball.
#
# So this gate: unpacks the bundle into a fresh directory; scrubs every variable that could
# reach back to the originals; configures in a build directory created for this run only; and
# then GREPS THE GENERATED link.txt to prove that what was linked came from the bundle's own
# paths. That last step is the one that makes the rest mean anything - a build can find the
# right headers and still link the wrong archive, and link.txt is where that becomes visible.
#
# TWO builds, because one is not enough:
#   hello  - the smallest thing that exercises the whole chain: the corrected headers, the
#            overlay archive under --whole-archive, the corrected linker script, crt1.o last,
#            and create-fself turning the ELF into an eboot.bin. If this fails, the bundle's
#            LAYOUT is wrong and nothing else matters.
#   port   - a real consumer, unmodified, pointed at the bundle with one variable. This is the
#            one that catches what hello cannot: C++, libc++ include ordering, Mesa/RADV
#            actually linking, thousands of translation units, and a build system that was
#            written against a checkout rather than a bundle. --port defaults to the sibling
#            OpenGothic checkout because its ps4/build.sh is the org's standard entry point.
# =========================================================================================
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass (BUNDLE.txt is stamped gate=pass) · 1 a stage FAILED · 2 usage ·
#             4 INCOMPLETE - a required host tool is missing, so the gate did not run.
