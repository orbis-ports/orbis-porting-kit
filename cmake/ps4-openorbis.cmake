# Include order for C++: libc++ FIRST, the SDK's C headers second. This is not cosmetic.
#
# libc++ ships C-header wrappers of its own — include/c++/v1/{math.h,stdlib.h,string.h,…} —
# each of which `#include_next`es the platform header and then adds the C++ overloads the
# standard requires. The float `abs` overloads live in libc++'s <stdlib.h>; libc++'s
# <math.h> includes it; <cmath> then does an unconditional `using ::abs;` to pull all of
# them into namespace std. That chain only works if libc++'s directory is searched before
# the C one — otherwise `#include <stdlib.h>` from inside libc++ lands on musl's header,
# whose only `abs` is `int abs(int)`.
#
# With the C directory first, as it once was, the chain broke twice over:
#   * <cmath> failed outright — `using ::abs;` with no ::abs declared anywhere;
#   * the workaround for that, `-include stdlib.h`, made musl's `int abs(int)` visible in
#     every TU at global scope. <cmath> then compiled, but std::abs was the INTEGER
#     overload and nothing else, so `std::abs(x)` on a float silently truncated to int and
#     converted back. clang says so (-Wabsolute-value, on by default) but it is only a
#     warning: cross-building OpenGothic hit 37 such call sites. Codegen is the proof —
#     wrong order emits cvttss2si/cvtsi2ss, this one emits andps.
#
# A PREFIX IS STILL NEEDED, for the OTHER, load-bearing reason: the SDK's own headers are not
# self-contained — orbis/Net.h and friends name size_t without including <stddef.h> — and every TU
# that touches them relies on the prefix having declared it. Dropping it entirely fails on
# `unknown type name 'size_t'` in any TU that includes orbis/Net.h.
#
# ⚠ BUT IT IS NO LONGER stdlib.h. orbis-compat ships `orbis_prefix.h`, which is <stddef.h> and
# <stdint.h> and nothing else. Measured across all 189 of the SDK's orbis/ headers compiled alone:
#
#     no prefix                26 fail
#     -include stdlib.h        16 fail      <- what this file used to pass
#     -include orbis_prefix.h   7 fail
#
# Better coverage from a far smaller injection - two type headers instead of a whole libc one, which
# matters precisely because of the paragraph above: a libc header in every TU at global scope is how
# the std::abs truncation happened in the first place. (The remaining seven are SDK bugs - a typo'd
# type name, an undefined type, clang builtins redeclared - and no prefix reaches those.)
#
# ⚠ And orbis-compat goes BETWEEN them, not first: libc++'s directory has to stay ahead for the
# reason above, while the overlay only has to be ahead of the SDK's C headers, which it now is.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORBIS_CRT
#
# WHICH C RUNTIME STARTUP OBJECT GOES ON THE LINK LINE: `sdk` (the default) or `own`.
#
#     -DORBIS_CRT=own          or   ORBIS_CRT=own in the environment
#
# Resolved the same way OO_PS4_TOOLCHAIN and ORBIS_COMPAT_DIR are above - an explicit -D first, then
# the environment, then a default - because a knob that only one of those three reaches is a knob
# somebody will set and watch do nothing. The compile-time relatives of this switch are
# ORBIS_UMTX_LIBKERNEL (README §6.3) and the runtime ones ORBIS_THREAD_STACK and ORBIS_SIGEV_THREAD;
# all of them exist so an A/B can be run by the person holding the console rather than scheduled.
#
# ⚠ THIS ONE COSTS A RELINK, NOT A REBUILD, and that is the most it can cost. Both objects are built
# unconditionally - the SDK ships its set, `./build.sh` produces ours - so switching is `cmake
# -DORBIS_CRT=own` over an existing build directory and whatever relinks. Nothing recompiles.
#
# WHY THE DEFAULT IS `sdk` WHEN THE POINT OF crt/ IS TO REPLACE IT. Everything this repository can
# check about the replacement passes, and that is genuinely a lot: test/crt_abi.sh finds every
# allocatable data section byte-identical to the SDK's crt1.o - `.data.sce_process_param`,
# `.data.rel.ro._sceLibcParam` and the four blocks it points at, `.data` with the heap knobs in it -
# every relocation identical, and `.text._start_ps4_c` identical instruction for instruction. But
# NOTHING HAS LINKED IT, on this machine or anywhere: there is no ld.lld here and no console, so the
# first time these objects meet a linker will be on somebody else's machine. And there is one
# deliberate link-visible change in them - `__dso_handle` is weak-hidden-global where the SDK's is
# local, because six members of the SDK's libc++.a reference it as GLOBAL HIDDEN UND and nothing in
# the SDK defines it globally - which is exactly the kind of change that a link, and only a link,
# decides the meaning of.
#
# So the default stays with the object this port has booted and played a game on, and flipping it is
# a one-word change for whoever runs the experiment. The condition for flipping it is not a feeling:
#
#     confirming ORBIS_CRT=own

#     # the title's first log line at all (the loader accepted the image and reached _start), a line

#     # reaching the point it reaches today. A black screen with "Cannot start the application" and
#     # no log is the loader refusing the image, which is a parameter-block or segment problem;
#     # a log that starts and stops before any constructor is the .init_array end of it.
#     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
